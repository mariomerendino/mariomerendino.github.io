                <p class = "textBlock">
                    Hello! Welcome to Merendino Solutions! My name is Mario J. Merendino and I am a software developer.
                    I have been programming for the past 3 years, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. I love
                    having the ability to create something from the ground up and watching my ideas come to life. I enjoy
                    working on any type of programming project whether its front-end UI development, where I am working closely
                    with the user experience and creating an application that any one could use. I also enjoy back-end development
                    too, where I am working with large data sets, and coming up with the best solution to make the program efficient. 
                    I am always looking into new technologies and what is hot in our industry. New tools like <i>Facebooks</i> React-Native Framework,
                    and <i>Googles</i> new Firebase DB are now becoming super popular in the programming community. I love picking up a new tool
                    and playing around with it to see if its something I could see my self using. 
                </p>
                
                
                <h3>Education and Skills:</h3>
                <p class = "textBlock">
                    I am currently attending Fordham University and I am studying Computer Science and also minoring in Economics. I love my 
                    university, and college has been a blast, but the problem with learning software development in a class room setting is that
                    sometimes its not enough. You cannot learn everyting you need to use in a real world enviornment just from your in class education.
                    What I have learned outside of the classroom is probably the more important and relvant to real software development. 
                    <br>
                    Below is a list of my technical skills, however this is just a list of things I am proficent in, not everything I know.

                    <b>Technical Skills:</b> Java, C#, C++, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Android Development, Unix & Bash Scripting, SQL Server.
